This is a collection of batch script that pretend to be Unix commands in a very perfunctory sense. Any command "implemented" here probably only does its most common use case, and probably in a technically incorrect manner. Don't even THINK about using flags. I usually put these scripts somewhere in my path on Windows so that when I, late at night, type "ls", it just runs "dir" and doesn't complain. I assume someone somewhere has already done all this, and much more thoroughly, but I can't be bothered look it up.
