Wnix (pronounced "OO-nicks") is a collection of batch scripts for Microsoft Windows that pretend to be Unix commands in a very perfunctory sense. Any command "implemented" here probably only does its most common use case, and probably in a technically incorrect manner. Don't even THINK about using flags. I usually put these scripts somewhere in my path on Windows so that when I, late at night, type "ls", it just runs "dir" and doesn't complain. I assume someone somewhere has already done all this, and much more thoroughly, but I can't be bothered look it up. License: public domain under CC0, except where otherwise noted.

I think there's actually a problem with most of these, which is that they're implemented as batch files, but if a batch file calls another batch file, in the simple way you would call executables, execution never returns to the original file, like calling an executable would. So you can't use these in scripts. But then again: you shouldn't, because no one else has this library installed, anyway.
